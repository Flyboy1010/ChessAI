# ChessAI
Chess AI with the minimax and alpha beta pruning algorithm

Some things:

1. There are 3 rules i didnt implement: en passant, 3 move repetition rule, and you can castle while in check.
2. The move generation code for the pawn, and look for checks could be improved
3. There is a thread in the game manager class for doing the moves of the ai that i dont like too much, i dont think it is the right way to do that, i am open to sugestions
